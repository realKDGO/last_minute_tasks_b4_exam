## üîê Bonus Task: ATM Simulation

üìù **Description:**  
Create a simple ATM simulation program that allows a user to interact with basic banking features. The program must begin with **PIN verification** and allow the user up to **three attempts** to enter the correct PIN. After logging in, the user can choose from a menu of banking options. The system should also allow **PIN resetting** and must print a **receipt** showing the final balance upon exiting.

‚úÖ **Objectives:**  
**1.** Prompt the user for a 4-digit PIN (default: `1234`), and allow up to 3 attempts.

**2.** If the correct PIN is entered, display an ATM menu with these options:  
  ‚Ä¢ Check Balance  
  ‚Ä¢ Deposit  
  ‚Ä¢ Withdraw  
  ‚Ä¢ Reset PIN  
  ‚Ä¢ Exit and Print Receipt  

**3.** Perform the appropriate action for each menu selection:  
  ‚Ä¢ **Check Balance:** Display current account balance.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Deposit:** Ask for an amount and add it to the balance.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Withdraw:** Ask for an amount and subtract if funds are sufficient.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Reset PIN:** Verify current PIN, then allow setting a new one.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Exit:** Show a final receipt including the balance and exit the program.  

**4.** Use only **basic variables,** **loops,** **and** **conditionals**‚Äîno methods, arrays, or advanced Java features.

üìå **Sample Receipt on Exit:**  
--- ATM Receipt ---  
Final Balance: `‚Ç±[amount]`  
Thank you for banking with us!
